  # Fix Analytics RLS Policies

  1. Changes
    - Drop existing RLS policies for analytics table
    - Create new, more permissive policies that allow:
      - Insert for authenticated users
      - Select/Update for users with matching venue_id
  
  2. Security
    - Maintains basic security while allowing necessary operations
    - Ensures users can only access their own venue's analytics
